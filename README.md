## Key Findings

- Astrocytes undergo a metabolic switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, decreasing lactate supply to neurons.
- Genes involved in the degradation of branched-chain amino acids are downregulated, with 'dld' identified as a central regulator.
- The synthesis of ketone bodies increases in neurons, while astrocytes increase their utilization, which aligns with the neuronal energy deficit in favor of astrocytes.
